Meetings
--------

Our meetings are held at 7pm on the first Friday of every month, on the
Market level (lowest level) of the food court in Lenox Mall, near the
outside doors. When you enter in the outside doors on Market Level, look
for the table in the middle or close the glass full of laptops and cables.
There is parking very close to the food court, directly opposite the mall
from Peachtree.

Lenox Square Mall
3393 Peachtree Rd NE
Atlanta, GA 30326

All ages/skill levels welcome. No dues, feel free to bring new friends.

Sign up for the chat/discussion list - it's low traffic, keeps you in
the loop, and enables you to communicate with the other 2600 folks:

You can also reach us on the Freenode IRC network, [#atl2600](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23atl2600)

We're trying something new this month and will be running a tiny version
of Defcon's Data Duplication village: https://dcddv.org
Bring a empty usb drive, 32GB or bigger if you'd like a copy of what we
have to offer this month. There's con videos, VMs, zines, and it's boots
into the latest Kali Linux. Checksum([MD5SUMS](datadup/2019-04/MD5SUMS.txt.asc))([SHA1SUMS](datadup/2019-04/SHA1SUMS.txt.asc))
files available to build trust in the content.

Usually once a year, somebody throws a B-sides conference in Atlanta. In 2015, it
happened at Atlanta Tech Village, and was a heck of a good time. See related:
