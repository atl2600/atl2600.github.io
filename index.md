Meetings
--------

Our meetings are held at 7pm on the first Friday of every month, on the
Market level (lowest level) of the food court in Lenox Mall, near the 
outside doors. When you enter in the outside doors on Market Level, look
for the table in the middle or close the glass full of laptops and cables.
There is parking very close to the food court, directly opposite the mall
from Peachtree.

Lenox Square Mall
3393 Peachtree Rd NE
Atlanta, GA 30326

All ages/skill levels welcome. No dues, feel free to bring new friends.

Sign up for the chat/discussion list - it's low traffic, keeps you in
the loop, and enables you to communicate with the other 2600 folks:

You can also reach us on the Freenode IRC network, [#atl2600](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23atl2600)

### B-Sides Atlanta

Usually once a year, somebody throws a B-sides conference in Atlanta. In 2015, it 
happened at Atlanta Tech Village, and was a heck of a good time. See related:

Puzzles
-------

Every month, there's a puzzle announced to our twitter feed and mailing list.
The puzzles are really simple, usually just two operations to decode or encode.
The puzzles are all solvable with utilities available in modern GNU/Linux
distributions.
