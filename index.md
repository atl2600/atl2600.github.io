Meetings
--------

Our meetings are held on the Market level (lowest level) of the food
court in Lenox Mall, near the outside doors. When you enter in the
outside doors on Market Level, look for the table in the middle or close
the glass full of laptops and cables. There is parking very close to the
food court, directly opposite the mall from Peachtree.

Lenox Square Mall
3393 Peachtree Rd NE
Atlanta, GA 30326

All ages/skill levels welcome. No dues, feel free to bring new friends.

Sign up for the chat/discussion list - it's low traffic, keeps you in
the loop, and enables you to communicate with the other 2600 folks:
