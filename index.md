Meetings
--------

Our meetings are held at 6pm on the first Friday of every month. Feel free to
drop in any time! The in-person meetings occur on the Market level (lowest
level) of the food court in Lenox Mall, near the outside doors. When you enter
in the outside doors on Market Level, look for the table in the middle or close
the glass full of laptops and cables.  There is parking very close to the food
court, directly opposite the mall from Peachtree.

Lenox Square Mall
3393 Peachtree Rd NE
Atlanta, GA 30326

During the recent pandemic, we have been gathering online on a server hosted by
one of the regulars. No RSVP or registration is necessary. The link to the
meeting is
[https://rsvz.userserviceable.com/b/bri-kha-6kx](https://rsvz.userserviceable.com/b/bri-kha-6kx) . If you find yourself alone on the virtual meeting, feel free to hang out, someone may show up, or come in person if possible.

All ages/skill levels welcome. No dues, feel free to bring new friends.

The most-used chat mechanism between meetings is the Atlanta CyberSecurity Engineers
discord server. An invite is available at https://discord.gg/SCvAgvA

There is often a mini-ctf called NetKotH, so bring a machine with Kali installed,
and try to get your handle on the scoreboard. If you want a buddy don't be afraid
to ask, the only things we byte are chips!

### B-Sides Atlanta

Usually once a year, somebody throws a B-sides conference in Atlanta. In 2015, it
happened at Atlanta Tech Village, and was a heck of a good time. See related:
